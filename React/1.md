### 1. What is React?

Answer:
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It’s component-based, which means I can break the UI into reusable pieces, and it uses a virtual DOM to make rendering fast and efficient.

### 2. What is the Virtual DOM?

Answer:
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. Whenever the state changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous one and updates only the parts that actually changed. This makes the UI very fast.

### 3. What are components in React?

Answer:
Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI. They allow me to build applications in a modular way. React supports two types: functional components and class components, but functional components are the modern standard.

### 4. What is JSX?

Answer:
JSX is a syntax extension that lets me write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes the UI easier to understand and maintain, and React converts it into JavaScript under the hood.

### 5. What are props?

Answer:
Props are inputs to a component. They are passed from the parent component to the child component, and they are read-only. I use props when I want to pass data or functions to children.

### 6. What is state?

Answer:
State is data that is managed inside a component and can change over time. When state changes, React re-renders the component. I typically use the useState hook to manage state in functional components.

### 7. Difference between props and state?

Answer:
Props are passed from parent to child and are immutable. State is managed within the component and can change. When state changes, it triggers a re-render, but props do not.

### 8. What is useState?

Answer:
useState is a hook that allows me to add state to a functional component. It returns a state variable and a function to update that state.

### 9. What is useEffect?

Answer:
useEffect lets me perform side effects in a component, such as fetching data, setting up event listeners, or managing timers. It runs after the render cycle and can be controlled using a dependency array.

### 10. What is conditional rendering?

Answer:
Conditional rendering means showing different UI elements based on certain conditions. For example, showing a login page if the user isn’t logged in.

### 11. What is lifting state up?

Answer:
Lifting state up means moving shared state to a common parent component so that multiple child components can access or modify the same data.

### 12. What are controlled and uncontrolled components?

Answer:
Controlled components get their value from React state, so React controls the input.
Uncontrolled components use refs to access the DOM directly, and the value is controlled by the browser.

### 13. What is useRef?

Answer:
useRef is a hook that lets me store a mutable value that doesn’t trigger a re-render. I mainly use it for accessing DOM elements or storing values like previous state.

### 14. What is the Context API?

Answer:
The Context API helps avoid prop drilling. It allows me to share data across multiple components without passing props manually through every level.

### 15. What does React.memo do?

Answer:
React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders. If the props don’t change, the component will not re-render, which improves performance.

### 16. What is useCallback?

Answer:
useCallback memoizes a function, so it doesn’t get recreated on every render. It’s useful when passing functions to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 17. What is useMemo?

Answer:
useMemo memoizes a computed value. I use it when performing expensive calculations so the computation runs only when dependencies change.

### 18. Why do we use keys in lists?

Answer:
Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. They improve performance during list re-rendering.

### 19. What are React Fragments?

Answer:
Fragments let me group multiple elements without adding an extra wrapper div. This keeps the DOM clean.

### 20. What is reconciliation?

Answer:
Reconciliation is React’s process of updating the DOM by comparing the virtual DOM with the previous one and applying only the differences.

### 21. What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?

Answer:
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. It’s a pattern used for reusability.

### 22. What is Redux?

Answer:
Redux is a state management library that centralizes application state. It works with a single store, actions to describe changes, and reducers to update state.

### 23. How does Redux work?

Answer:
The UI dispatches an action → the reducer processes the action → a new state is created → the UI updates. It's a predictable cycle.

### 24. What is Redux Thunk?

Answer:
Thunk is a middleware that allows writing asynchronous logic in Redux, like API calls.

### 25. Difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?

Answer:
useEffect runs after the DOM is painted, while useLayoutEffect runs before the paint. useLayoutEffect is used when I need the browser to apply changes synchronously.

### 26. What is React Suspense?

Answer:
Suspense allows me to load components lazily and show a fallback UI while the component is loading.

### 27. What is React.lazy?

Answer:
React.lazy enables code splitting by loading a component only when it’s needed.

### 28. What is hydration?

Answer:
Hydration is the process where React attaches event listeners to HTML generated by the server during SSR.

### 29. How is React different from Next.js?

Answer:
React focuses on the UI layer, while Next.js adds features like server-side rendering, file-based routing, and API routes.

### 30. Why is React fast?

Answer:
React is fast mainly because of its virtual DOM, component-based architecture, and efficient reconciliation algorithm.
